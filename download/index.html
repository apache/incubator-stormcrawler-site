    <h2>Release Integrity</h2>
    <p>You <b>must</b> <a href="https://www.apache.org/info/verification.html">verify</a> the integrity of the
        downloaded files. We provide OpenPGP signatures (*.asc files) for every release file. This signature should be
        matched against <a href="https://downloads.apache.org/incubator/stormcrawler/KEYS">KEYS</a> file which contains the
        OpenPGP keys of StormCrawlersâ€™s Release Managers. We also provide SHA-512 checksums for every release file.
        After you download the file, you should calculate a checksum for your download, and make sure it is the same as
        ours. </p>
    <p>More information about release signing and verifying signatures can be found <a
            href="https://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing.html">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>Apache StormCrawler is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the
        Apache Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
        the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with
        other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or
        stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</p>

    <p>All code merges require approval from at least one StormCrawler committer. Most StormCrawler committers are also members of the PPMC. Releases require that at least three StormCrawler PPMC members approve the release.</p>

    <p>We are looking to build up the number of committers and PPMC members. We will invite people to join the team. This is based on meritocracy. Contributors who have become involved in the StormCrawler community and who have shown a good level of understanding of the StormCrawler code base will be considered. </p>

    <p>Code reviews and votes on releases can be made by anyone.</p>
